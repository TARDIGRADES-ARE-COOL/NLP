## üîç Overview
This repository implements the **text-preprocessing** portion of an NLP workflow using Python, NLTK, and pandas. You‚Äôll see how to prepare raw text for downstream tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling by:

- Normalizing case  
- Removing stopwords and punctuation  
- Tokenizing into words  
- Lemmatizing to dictionary forms  
- Extracting and counting unigrams  

---

## ‚≠ê Features
- **Lowercasing**: Normalize all text to lowercase.  
- **Stopword Removal**: Drop common words (excluding negation words like `not`).  
- **Punctuation Stripping**: Replace rating symbols (`*`) and remove other non-word characters.  
- **Tokenization**: Convert sentences into word tokens.  
- **Lemmatization**: Map tokens to their base forms with WordNet.  
- **Unigram Extraction**: Compute frequency counts of individual words.
